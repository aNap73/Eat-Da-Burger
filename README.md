### Why I think it's cool

#### This program uses MVC or (Model, View Controller)

This design pattern is a bit trickey to set up and get used to at first, but it has a TON of advantages, of which two strong ones are it's flexibility and ease of maintenance. 

#### Home Grown ORM's

This program also uses an orm (Object Relational Model) I kind of rolled it from scratch after learning how in class. I'm still a little leary of orm's as an old database speed hacker, I can see where there could be issues. This one however is really simple and seems to get it's job done communicating with the model.

We've been using sequelize in class this week, so the idea of an ORM really is making more sense now, and having made one by hand now, was a fun exercise.

#### Model

The Model reminds me alot of the server in a client server app. Mine was very simple,pretty much a straight forward decoder between the orm and the front end however, I could see where you could add many different kind of complicated operations here to meet buisness requirements.

#### View

I had some fun with handlebars.js and I was able to bring the package into this project and use it to mash the model objects and html from the views and partials into beautiful burger themed fun.

#### Controler

Express, I have to say setting up routes is ALOT of fun. My grandfather was a lineman for "The Phone Company" so growing up, I heard all the stories about the switches, as I grew older my Mom worked for the Labs, and then Lucent, Avaya, etc.. So I have a HUGE appreciation for the history of the protocols that for so many years made up the backbone of human society and still do. Wielding those keywords in express, managing html gets puts posts and deletes through restful, great fun. It makes me really, really happy to finaly become fluent in these necessary skills.

#### I heard you like programs; so I put some programs in your programs?

I always find it amusing when it becomes time to stuff one program into another, so it can shoot out at some point and do it's job. One of my most proud moments was when the first litte piece of code, I taught how to upgrade itself in the field, called home, patched itself remotely, and checked back in operational. I still think of that little program and smile.
